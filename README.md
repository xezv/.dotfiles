# Dotfiles Setup

`dotfiles` for development environment

## Usage

```bash
# 1. move to your home directory
$ cd $HOME

# 2. clone the `.dotfiles` repository
$ git clone https://github.com/xezv/dotfiles

# 3. move to the cloned directory
cd dotfiles

# 4. grant execution permission to the setup script
$ chmod +x setup.sh

$ ./setup.sh
```

done.

notice that `dotfiles` directory is not deleted after setup.

config files created by the `setup.sh` script are just symlinks.
